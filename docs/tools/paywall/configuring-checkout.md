# Configuring Checkout

## Building a Purchase address

If you are using the paywall application, you can skip this section and move to the next one (the `paywallConfig` object).

All of the purchase URsL start with the following base

:::caution

If you are looking for a way to use the legacy unlock checkout, use `/legacy/checkout?` as path.

:::

```
https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?
```

After this, you will need to include the following parameters:

- `paywallConfig=...` where `...` is replaced with the URL-encoded version of a JSON `paywallConfig` object. The next section will show you how to build this object.
- `redirectUri=...` where `...` is replaced with the URL-encodded address of a webpage where the user will be redirected when their membership is valid.

These parameters are all separated by the `&` sign and you can use online tools such as [https://www.urlencoder.io/](https://www.urlencoder.io/) to build the encoded version of the parameters.

### Example

```text
https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?redirectUri=https://ouvre-boite.com&paywallConfig=%7B%22locks%22%3A%7B%220x15F67811Beb43aCE162693fe1415916F87B8C5C2%22%3A%7B%22network%22%3A137%7D%7D%2C%22persistentCheckout%22%3Atrue%2C%22icon%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Frinkeby.locksmith.unlock-protocol.com%2Flock%2F0x15F67811Beb43aCE162693fe1415916F87B8C5C2%2Ficon%22%7D
```

This URL will redirect members to this page [`https://ouvre-boite.com/`](https://ouvre-boite.com/).

## The paywallConfig object

The `paywallConfig` is a JSON object which includes a set of customizations for your experience. It includes the following elements:

- `locks` : _required object_, a list of lock objects \(see below\).
- `title`: _optional string_, a title for your checkout. This will show up on the head.
- `icon`: _optional string_, the URL for a icon to display in the top left corner of the modal.
- `callToAction`: _optional object_, a list of messages shown based on the state of the checkout modal \(see below\).
- `metadataInputs`: _optional array_, a set of input fields [as explained there](collecting-metadata.md).
- `persistentCheckout`: _optional boolean_: `true` \_\_if the modal cannot be closed, defaults to `false` when embedded. When closed, the user will be redirected to the `redirect` query param when using a purchase address \(see above\).
- `useDelegatedProvider`: _optional boolean._ To be announced.
- `network`: _optional integer._ defaults to `1`. See below.
- `referrer`: _optional string_. The address which will [receive UDT tokens](../../governance/the-unlock-token/) \(if the transaction is applicable\)
- `messageToSign`: _optional string_. If supplied, the user is prompted to sign this message using their wallet. If using a checkout URL, a `signature` query param is then appended to the `redirectUri` \(see above\). If using the embedded paywall, the `unlockProtocol.authenticated` includes the `signature` attribute.
- `pessimistic`: _optional boolean._ defaults to `false`_._ By default, to reduce friction, we do not require users to wait for the transaction to be mined before offering them to be redirected. By setting this to `true`, users will need to wait for the transaction to have been mined in order to proceed to the next step.

### Locks

The locks object is a list of objects indexed by the lock address, where each object can include the following:

- `network`: _recommended integer_. See below.
- `name`: _optional string_. name of the lock to display.
- `recurringPayments`: optional number. The number of time a membership should be renewed automatically. This only applies to ERC20 locks.
- `metadataInputs`: _optional array_, a set of input fields [as explained there](collecting-metadata.md).
- `minRecipients`: \_optional number, set the minimum number of memberships a user needs to purchase.
- `maxRecipients`: \_optional number, set the max number of memberships a user can purchase. Note: By default, checkout doesn't allow fiddling with quantity. You have to set maxRecipients to allow for changing to quantity.

### Calls to action (Legacy)

:::caution

Call to action options are not available in the redesigned checkout. They will however continue to work in the legacy checkout if you want to use them.

:::

The `callToAction` object lets you customize the messages displayed on the checkout UI. They are all optional strings:

- `default` : displayed by default
- `expired` : displayed when the user had a membership previously that expired
- `metadata`: displayed when the user is prompted for metadata
- `quantity`: displayed when user needs to select the quantity for the membership
- `messageToSign`: displayed when user needs to sign a message provided by you
- `captcha`: displayed if captcha is enabled and user needs to solve it.
- `card`: displayed on the card payment selection screen
- `returning`: displayed if user already has a membership
- `confirmed`: displayed when user need to confirm their purchase
- `minting`: displayed at the end when NFT is being minted

### Network values

(Make sure you use a number and not a string!)

- `1`: mainnet,
- `4`: rinkeby,
- `100`: xdai,
- `137`: polygon.
