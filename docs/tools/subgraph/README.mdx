  Querying smart contracts directly from your application is always an option,

# Unlock Subgraph Introduction

Unlock has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Unlock smart contracts.

Unlock leverages the [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) to simplify the process of making meaningful applications leveraging the Unlock Smart Contracts and associated data.

The Graph Protocol provides an accessible GraphQL service providing useful aggregate Unlock data from the Ethereum blockchain. The links below provide a rudimentary tool to build and test your queries.

NB: As of 2022, September 29 a new version of the subgraph containing breaking changes has been deployed for all existing chains. Subsequently the subgraph URL has been updated with a `-v2` suffix pointing to the new version, as previous URLs will be shut down.
