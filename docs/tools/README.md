# Tools

These are tools built by developers and for developers, to support developers who are building with Unlock Protocol and beyond.

These tools are not part of the core protocol and are completely optional. You are also welcome to build your own version of these tools in the applications you build.

Also, you should consider _external_ tools that are not specific to Unlock.

## Block Explorers

You can also interact with the deployed Unlock contract for a given network via block explorer's like etherscan. This can be useful as the current dashboard UI only exposes a small portion of the full functionality available on deployed locks.
